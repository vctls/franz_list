# Franz List

üöß WIP

A simple checklist web app.

At worst it will let me play a bit with React,  
at best it may finally provide an app that fits my needs.

## Goals

Make a checklist web app that can be used on desktop or mobile with touch, mouse or keyboard.  
See issues for expected features.  

## Usage

### Mouse or touch
Fill form and submit to add items.  
Click or tap item to toggle done state.  
Swipe item left to remove it.  
Swipe right to ‚Äúedit‚Äù it. (Actually just removes it and puts its values back into the form.)  

### Keyboard
Use Tab and Shift+Tab to focus form items or list.  
Use Tab and Shift+Tab or ArrowUp and ArrowDown to move the focus up and down the list.  
Use Space to toggle done state.  
Use ArrowLeft to delete and ArrowRight to ‚Äúedit‚Äù.
